# Health Tracker
## Description
- **Finger Exercises:** One key part of health is building finger strength and endurance. On the main page, display a number and a button. The number should increase when the button is clicked.
- **Stopwatch:** Still on the main page, add a stopwatch. Have a button to `Start/Pause` and `Reset` the clock. The start/pause button should toggle between saying “start” and “pause.” And you should only be able to reset when the stopwatch is paused.
- **Inspiring Image Carousel:** At the top of our main page, we want to inspire our users with images of the type of person they can become. Display an image with a caption below it.
