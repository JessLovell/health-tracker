# Health Tracker
## Description
- **Finger Exercises:** One key part of health is building finger strength and endurance. On the main page, display a number and a button. The number should increase when the button is clicked.
- **Stopwatch:** Still on the main page, add a stopwatch. Have a button to `Start/Pause` and `Reset` the clock. The start/pause button should toggle between saying “start” and “pause.” And you should only be able to reset when the stopwatch is paused.
- **Inspiring Image Carousel:** At the top of our main page, we want to inspire our users with images of the type of person they can become. Display an image with a caption below it.
- **Navigation:** Move your Finger Exercises and Stopwatch into their own pages of your app. Add buttons on the homepage to link to those pages, and ensure that the user can use the back button on the device to return to the app homepage. (It’s good practice to include some sort of back button on the page as well.)
- **Health Notifications:** Create a new activity for Notifications. Allow users to set up reminders to drink water, which should appear every 2 hours in the notification bar. (For testing, you might want to shorten this to 15 or 30 seconds.)
- **Styling:** Apply consistent styling across the various Activities in your app. Make sure they have a consistent look and feel, and that buttons are in similar locations on each screen.
